## AIM:

To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm

1. Store all 8 possible moves a knight can make using dx[] and dy[] arrays.
2. Use a queue to perform Breadth-First Search starting from the knightâ€™s initial position, with step distance 0.
3. Create a 2D boolean array visited[][] to ensure each cell is only processed once.
4. For each valid move within bounds and not yet visited, mark as visited, add to the queue with distance incremented.
5. If the current cell matches the target position, return the distance as the minimum steps needed.

## Program:

    dy = [-1, -2, -2, -1, 1, 2, 2, 1]

        for i in range(8):
            x = curr.x + dx[i]
            y = curr.y + dy[i]

            if isInside(x, y, N) and not visited[x][y]:
                visited[x][y] = True
                queue.append(cell(x, y, curr.dist + 1))

    return float('inf')

    N = 30
    knightpos = [1, 1]
    targetpos = [30, 30]
    print(minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,
                               targetpos, N))
```

## Output:

## Result:

The program executed successfully, and the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach the target was calculated.
